**Jenkins Interview Notes

 1.What is Jenkins ?
  - Jenkins is an open-source project written in java that runs on windows , macOS ,Unix and other operating system it is free , community support and lots of plugins port no - 8080

 - Jenkins automate the entire software lifecycle 
 - Jenkins was originally developed by Sun microsystem in 2004 under the name Hudson
 - The project was later named Jenkins when oracle bought Microsystems
 - whenever developers write code , we integrate all that code of all developers at that point of time and we build ,test and deliver/deploy to the client this process is called CI/CD
 - Jenkins helps us to achieve this because of CI , nows bugs will be reported fast and get rectified fast so the entire software development happens that.

2. Workflow of Jenkins ?
   1.Code Commit to GitHub  
        Developers push code changes to a GitHub repository.
        A GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins to initiate the pipeline upon code commits.
   2.Code Checkout by Jenkins
        Jenkins uses the Git plugin to clone the latest code from the repository.
   3.Build with Maven
       Jenkins invokes Maven to compile the code, resolve dependencies, and run unit tests.
       The typical Maven goal used is clean install
   4.Automated Testing with Selenium
       Post-build, Jenkins executes Selenium test suites to perform automated UI testing.
       Test results are collected and can be displayed using Jenkins plugins like JUnit or Allure.
   5.Artifact Deployment to Artifactory
       Upon successful testing, Jenkins deploys the build artifacts (e.g., JAR, WAR files) to JFrog Artifactory.
       This is facilitated by the Jenkins Artifactory plugin, which manages artifact uploads and metadata. 
   6.Code Quality Analysis
       Integrate tools like SonarQube to analyze code quality and enforce standards.
       Jenkins can be configured to run SonarQube scans as part of the pipeline.
   7.Deployment to Environments
       Jenkins can automate deployment to various environments (e.g., staging, production) using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or traditional servers.
       Deployment steps can be defined within the Jenkins pipeline script.

3. Advantages of Jenkins

 -It has lots of plugins available
 - You can write your own plugins, we can use community plugin
 - Jenkins is not just tool , it is a framework - Exm - we can do whatever you want all you need in plugins
 - we can attach slaves (nodes) to Jenkins master it instruct other (slaves) to do job if slaves are not available Jenkins itself does the job
 - Jenkins also behave as crone server replacement i.e Can do scheduled task  
 - It can crate labels
